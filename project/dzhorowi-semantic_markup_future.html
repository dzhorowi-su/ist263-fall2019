          <p>The Roadster was the first car automaker Tesla ever produced. Tesla is the largest electric car manufacturer currently. The Roadster was based on the Lotus Elise and gave Tesla enough attention and money to begin mass producing cars.</p>

          <h2>2014</h2>
          <p>The Toyota Mirai was the first hydrogen fuel cell powered car. While Toyota started development in 1992, they were able to create a car for the masses in 2014. The car is on sale today, however it is uncommon due to its near $60,000 starting price tag and lack of hydrogen fuel cell charging stations.</p>

          <h2>2017</h2>
          <p>The Tesla Model 3 is a huge deal for the future of the automobile. It was the first fully electric car that was affordable starting under $35,000. Previously electric cars were reserved for the 1% however with new methods of lithium-ion production, electric cars can now be accessable for everyone.</p>

          <h2>Predicted 2030</h2>
          <p>While the future of the automobile is unknown, we are heading in the direction of fully electric, self-driving cars. Many automakers and technology companies such as Waymo have started developing self-driving cars. Tesla offers partial self-driving capabilities as a premium in many of their models. Within the next 10 years we should see the first ever fully self-driving automobile.</p>
