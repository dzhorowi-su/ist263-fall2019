The car is on sale today, however it is uncommon due to its near $60,000 starting price tag and lack of hydrogen fuel cell charging stations.</td>

        <td style="width: 200px;">The Tesla Model 3 is a huge deal for the future of the automobile. It was the first fully electric car that was affordable starting under $35,000.

        <td style="width: 200px;">While the future of the automobile is unknown, we are heading in the direction of fully electric, self-driving cars. Many automakers and technology companies such as Waymo have started developing self-driving cars. Tesla offers partial self-driving capabilities as a premium in many of their models. Within the next 10 years we should see the first ever fully self-driving automobile. </td>
